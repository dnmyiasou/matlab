# matlab
This is a test setup to see how github works.   I will be uploading some matlab files.  
To be truly useful for public I'd have to do a better job documenting them, but they work for me right now.

readcggtts.m  reads a cggtts file and outputs files in more useful formats for plotting and processing.
